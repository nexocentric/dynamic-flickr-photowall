Dynamic Flickr Photowall
========================

This is just a small project that I created for my wedding. The program leverages the Flickr photo API to poll my Flickr account and update the application webpage with photos that have been newly uploaded as they are uploaded to my Flickr account.

This was displayed on a projector screen at my wedding. Guests uploaded the pictures that they took from their cell phones to my Flickr account allowing me to get a copy of the pictures that they took. It was also a lot of fun for guests at the wedding.
